                Depending on the age of the person, 
                usually old people or mid-aged people 
                pressure other people to the gender 
                stereotypes because they themselves were 
                subjected to these binary gender stereotypes. 
                To the extent that most people that gender 
                stereotype start to gain an understanding of 
                what not to do or are always frowned upon.
